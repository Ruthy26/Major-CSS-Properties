            <p>My name is Ruth Odii and my love for technology no start today.</p>
            <p> I love the fruits of technology — being able to do new things they could never do before; doing things faster, easier, and cheaper than they could do them before. And the social benefits of technology—emails, Zoom, Slack and WhatsApp, it keeps me connected which is extremely important and the opportunities that comes with it.</p> <br>

       <!-- <h3 class="second-h3">Second section</h3> -->
     <div class="section_two">
            <p>So, what I have  learnt so far include;</p>

            <br/>

            <ul>
                <li>About the terminal and how to use it for collaboration.</li>
                <li>Version control system like Git and cloud-based git repository hosting service, such as Github.</li>
                <li>HTML aka. HyperText Markup Language which is the standard markup language used to structure a web page and its content.</li>
                <li>And also CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is  a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> And all these, has help me understand how important CSS is:</p>
            <p> In addition to layout and format, CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate.</p> <br>

            <p>One important model in CSS is the BOX MODEL, consisting of the margins, borders and paddings, but what is the differences between them. </p>

            <p>
                <b>MARGIN</b> - The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>BORDER</b> - The border property is a shorthand syntax in CSS that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is applied to. It sets the values of 'border-width', 'border-style', and 'border-color'.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>PADDING</b> - The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
